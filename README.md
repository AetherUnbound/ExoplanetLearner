# Exoplanet Learner
This is a research project investigating exoplanets, supervised learning, and how the two can be combined to determine which stars are most probable candidates for finding exoplanets in the near future. 

## Research outline and plans
My initial research proposal and project updates can all be found on my OneNote notebook: 
https://spuonline-my.sharepoint.com/personal/bowdenm_spu_edu/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=wjbr%2bHhsGnjMwQHMCMhnDt2je%2fWsW3vuKZtoV8MY6gY%3d&folderid=2_0f153858d436246bc87752802a8242055

Eventually I will try to move all of the relevant information from the notebook onto this README file.
